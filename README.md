# Who is this guide for?
Anyone who are interested to learn about blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Especially good for visual learner like me!

# How is this guide structured?
As a beginner, I am sure you have lots of questions. I believe it's best to let those questions to guide your learning journey. Therefore, this guide is structured as a set of questions and suggested resources that answer the question.

## What is blockchain?
- [A visual guide- Blockchain explained](http://graphics.reuters.com/TECHNOLOGY-BLOCKCHAIN/010070P11GN/index.html)
  - a single webpage with animations. It will help you visualize some of the important concepts in blockchain technology.  

## What is bitcoin and what problem does it solve?
- [But how does bitcoin actually work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4)
  - 26 mins video. It uses a simple peer-to-peer payment problem that we can easily relate to to explain what problem bitcoin solves and how bitcoin solves some technical challenges in order for the system to work without trusting any central party.


## I want to gain a more in-depth understanding of how bitcoin works?
- [bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
  - 9 pages pdf document. It's always interesting to go back to the document written by the father of bitcoin to learn how he thinks. You might encounter terms and diagrams that you don't understand and that's natural. I find the [learn me a bitcoin](https://learnmeabitcoin.com) to be an excellent resource to answer most of the questions that I have when reading the whitepaper. You can either browse the content or just search specific terms on the website.

## If you finished reading the above materials, you should have a good understanding of how bitcoin works. Here are a few questions you can ask yourself, or even better, try to teach someone else (Feyman technique) , so that you make sure you really understand:
- Why blockchain is called blockchain?
- In the context of bitcoin, what kind of data does a block consist of?
- How is new bitcoin "created"?/ What is bitcoin mining?/ Why do we say bitcoin mining is consuming too much energy and thus not environmentally friendly?
- Without a centralized party, how can we make sure no one fool the system? 
  - What happens after you 
  - How do we ensure people only spend what they have in their pocket?/ How do we define what's in their pocket?/ How do I proove my money is indeed mine?
  - How do we prevent people to spend their money simultaneously more than once(the double spending problem)?

## What is Ethereum? How is it different from Bitcoin?
- Simply put, the main difference is as follows:
  -  Bitcoin only tracks transactions
  -  Ethereum tracks transactions + allow people to program around how they would like to transact

## What does it mean to "program transactions"? What is smart contract?
- [Deploy your first Solidity smart contract with Remix IDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZKVfXmzRDw&t=916s)
  - 30 mins video. See the beauty of smart contract: how easy it is to program a "contract" that collects and sends money in a way defined by you.
- [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so)
  - Learn by building simple projects. It's an excellent learning experience: content is well-explained and you also get to interact with your cohort on Discord. Check out [the project I built with Buildspace](https://twitter.com/panyunyao/status/1453239167488561164).
- [Popular contract templates](https://github.com/marcelc63/popular-contract-templates)
  - A repository of well written smart contracts  
- [Solidity by example](https://solidity-by-example.org)
